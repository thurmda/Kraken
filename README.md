This is an experiment with jQuery and Raphael. 

Add this user script to Chrome or Firefox+Greasemonkey to install the Kraken. 
After downloading you can just drag and drop the file (Kraken.user.js) onto a 
browser instance. Then on ANY web page the key combo [cntrl]+[shift]+Z will 
summon the Kraken. Enter a jQuery selector into the input area, hit [enter], 
and then... 

The Kraken be smackin' your DOM.
